# Security Policy

## Overview
Security is of paramount importance to this project, especially since it deals with login functionalities.
That being said, an oopsie may happen and it is crucial for me to be informed promptly. This document provides an overview of the supported
versions and instructions on reporting any security-related issues or vulnerabilities you might discover.

## Supported Versions
`fastapi-sso` is still in its developmental phases, and we haven't rolled out a 1.0.0 release yet. Currently, I am offering support for all releases `0.7.0` and newer.

### What to Expect
I will acknowledge the receipt of your vulnerability report and keep you posted on the progress regularly.
